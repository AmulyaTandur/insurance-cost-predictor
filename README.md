## 📽 Abstract 

HealthyLife Insurance company has gathered the data regarding the customers and wants to analyze it. Different customers have different lifestyles and hence not all can have the same medical expenditures or requirement of health insurance. To better tailor the insurance package to be given to different customers, the company now wants to integrate machine learning into the process and identify the right insurance charges for each customer. You are hired as a ML Engineer to help the company predict the right charges based on the data that they have been maintaining for each customer.

## 🎯 Motivation

The motivation behind this project lies in addressing the growing need for fair and personalized health insurance pricing. Traditional methods of estimating insurance charges often rely on fixed rules or generalized assumptions, which may not capture the diversity of customer lifestyles and health risks.

By applying machine learning, we can uncover hidden patterns in customer data and predict insurance charges with greater accuracy. This not only benefits insurance companies by improving risk assessment and pricing strategies, but also ensures that customers are offered tailored packages aligned with their health profiles and lifestyle choices.
